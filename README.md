what i've explored so far:

Backend:

- using fetch API with different HTTP methods and content types
- server-sent events (SSE)
- integrating HTMX with Django
- adding TinyMCE for rich text editing
- a simple in-memory websocket chat using Daphne + Channels (no Redis)
- auth setup with DRF, Djoser, and Simple JWT
- fun extras like using TextBlob directly in a model


Frontend:

- working with Axios
- basic login flow
- Nuxt's file-based routing
- using the Composition API
